/*C++ if else and logical operators (con.)
This c++ program to compute the real roots of the equation: ax2+bx+c=0.

 x = -b + squareroot(b^2 - 4ac)/2a //formula
 
1. The program will prompt the user to input the values of a, b, and c. 
2. It then computes the real roots of the equation based on the following rules:
-if a and b are zero=> no solution
-if a is zero=>one root (-c/b)
-if b2-4ac is negative=>no roots
-Otherwise=> two roots
The roots can be computed using the following formula:
x1=-b+(b2-4ac)1/2/2a
x=-b-(b2-4ac)1/2/2a
